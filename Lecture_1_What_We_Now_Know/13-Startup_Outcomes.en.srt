00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
What can happen to a startup?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Well, the best thing that could happen to a startup is that it can grow into a company

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
and hopefully a large company after you found a repeatable and scalable business model.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Or 2 is well you can still pivoting and iterating as you continue to search for a business model.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Or 3 is you could have found a business model but may be one that isn't an explosive growth,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
but you could be growing slowly and barely breaking even.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Or 4 is maybe you never found the business model but you can make money

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and you run out of money in time and you shut your company down.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The answer is all of the above.
