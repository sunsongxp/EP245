1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now the last interesting thing that's a holdover from thinking about startups

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
as smaller versions of large companies is kind of the hardest to get your height around.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And that's large companies, they got VP of sales, what we need of VP of sales on day 1.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Large companies, they have had some marketing. I need to have a market.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
In large companies, they have bus dev and all those external organizations. We need those too.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Without ever thinking about what's the point?

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Why is it that we want to duplicate these same organizations?

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Cause if you're a founder like I was, boy, you really want someday to see

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
you on top and look at all these nice silos working for me.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Isn't this great and look, they're all doing their jobs, etc.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I have to tell you if this is your vision on day 1, you're already out of business.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Cause we now know that functional organizations actually are the wrong way

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
to set up sales marketing and bus dev on day 1.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
What we now know is that the founders need to run what's called the customer development team.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And a customer development team says,

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
"Listen, we're not going to have sales marketing and bus dev on day 1.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We're not going to hire a VP of sales on day 1.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We're actually going to have the founder get out of the building."

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And later in this lecture, we'll explain why.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's a really big idea to understand for organization, you need the founders spending at least

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
20% of their time outside the building, understanding customer's problems and needs,

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and figuring out how that matches with the features at your building

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
before you start organizing in functional organizations and silos.

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Well, the thing I mention which I'll expand on later in this course

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
is that one of the mistakes that we've also made for decades is confusing the titles,

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
sales marketing and bus dev with the job specifications.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It turns out that the title "VP of Sales" has a very different job spec in a large company

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
that it does on a startup of VP and marketing does very different things

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
in a large company than they do on a startup and for years,

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
we could never explain why is it that incredibly competent executives

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
who have been executing business models in large corporations collapse

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
in startups when they're company is smaller than their administrative staff in their large corporation.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It turns out that job specification, what we do day to day has nothing similar.
