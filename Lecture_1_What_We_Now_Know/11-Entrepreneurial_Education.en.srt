00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's just take a look at the last piece which is why you're here.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
How do we teach entrepreneurship?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Well, in the past, entrepreneurial education was about execution.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We're going to teach you how to write a business plan.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We're going to teach you how to put together the power point for the VC presentation.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
If we're doing it really well, we'll have you lots of research.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
But it really assumed it was all about execution. What we now know that's just simply not the case.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Entrepreneurial education, the reason why you're taking this class

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
is about the search for the business model and we're going to teach you how to search.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And so what that means about entrepreneurial education is that eventually

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
we do need you to know everything an MBA knows.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Eventually if your success in growing your startup into a large company,

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
you're going to need to know about accounting and HR

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and organizational behavior and global leadership and etc.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
But at first, you need a different set of skills that just never existed before,

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and so welcome to the first class of its type that's going to put search first and that's a radical change.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's not just one more methodology.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
This class is going to teach you all the skills about strategy and process and organization

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and eventually if you build a successful company, we'll then allow you to write the plans

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
and operating documents and financial spreadsheets to actually execute the company.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Hold on to your seats, we're about to get started and let's jump in

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
to business models and customer development.
