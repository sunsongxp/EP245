00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Today's lecture is what have we learned in entrepreneurship for the last 40 years.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
One of the interesting questions is why are you here?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I hope you're here to find out what does it take to go from an idea to a business.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
For the last 20 years if you wanted to know how to go from an idea to a business,

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
the answer from educators and investors are simply, "Well, go research and then write

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
a business plan and you'll know everything possible to actually start and run your business."

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We now know that advice was simply wrong--not kind of wrong but very wrong.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We now today know something we didn't know before.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We now know the right way to build startups and so this class is about that right way,

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
but before we get started, let's see how we took the wrong path

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and then see what we now know worse.
