1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The modern corporation as we know it was first formed in 1602

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
with the government chartered Dutch East India Company.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This is kind of the first modern corporation with shareholders and organizations

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
that kind of if you squinted looked like something closed to modern companies today.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
By the 1850s in the United States with railroads spanning the entire country,

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
corporations needed more sophisticated organizations

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and the fact the first org chart was drawn in 1856 to just manage corporations

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and by the beginning of the 20th century, educators started realizing

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
that there was a need for an educated management class to administer and execute these corporations

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
because at least in the United States we were going from local economies to regional economies

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
to a national economy, yet we did not have a trained management class

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and so in a brilliant insight, Harvard set up the first masters of business administration course

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
called the MBA and the first graduating class in 1910 was the first of a

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,000
cadre of business administrators that made the 20th century the modern corporate century.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The MBA curriculum is designed to provide managers and administrators

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
with the tools they needed to run existing and growing companies.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Accounting, strategy, operations, leadership, organizational behavior,

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
human resources management and these stack of tools were just incredibly important

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
for the growth of large companies but what's really interesting what that missed is that

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
they were really no tools provided in this curriculum for starting new businesses.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
One of the things we did not understand for 100 years

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
is that startups are not smaller versions of large companies.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Let me say it again--startups are not smaller versions of large companies

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:11,000
and what falls out of that is all the traditional tools taught and learned in an MBA curriculum

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
are irrelevant in the first chaotic year or two of an early stage venture.

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Eventually, you need that tool set but at first it really gets in the way.
