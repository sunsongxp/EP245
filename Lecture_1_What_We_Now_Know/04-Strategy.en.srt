1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
What we used to believe for strategy

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
is that you start any company with an operating plan and a financial model.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
What's an operating plan? Well, it's the business plan.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And the belief was all I need to do is spend a lot of time writing this plan,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and then all I need to do is execute it and somehow magical thinking said if I thought hard enough

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and if I was smart enough to do all the great market research in the library and looking up all the data

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
and then put together a forecast the magic 5-year plan in the back of the business plan

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
somehow magically all I needed to do is hire the people to execute that plan.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
If that doesn't sound silly to you now, don't worry because it didn't sound silly for 40 years,

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
but what we now know that's kind of ridiculous.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
What we now know is that no business plan survives first contact with customers.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The first years on a startup is completely unpredictable.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
What you think you're doing on Monday turns out to be completely wrong on Tuesday,

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and on Wednesday, you discover something new, and on Friday, you're almost out of business,

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
but on Monday you gets next Monday you get sold for a billion dollars.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
A startup is an incredible roller coaster unpredictable series of advance

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
that there's no way you could put together in a 5-year plan.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yet somehow investors and educators thought that maybe we could just teach you

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
how to put this all together in a nice spreadsheet.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
No one ever noticed that the only other people to do 5-year plans were these guys,

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
the Soviet Union, and we kind of know how well that turned out as well.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Though much like the fallacy about business plans and financial forecast that lasted for about 80 years.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The good news is that we now know that business plans and financial forecast

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
first are just as silly as it was in the Soviet Union.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
No business plan survives first contact with customers.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
This doesn't mean we shouldn't have any planning but it actually means

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
what we need is planning before the plan and what that really mean is

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
you need to figure out how to actually do some planning

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
and then you get to write the business plan.

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So I'll be clear, I'm not suggesting we never want to do an operating plan

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
and I'm not suggesting we never want forecast but you need some real facts before you could do that

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
and one of the ways we're going to organize our facts

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
is with Alexander Oscar Walters' Business Model Canvas.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
We'll talk about this canvas in some excruciating detail in the following lectures

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
but you should know we used to canvas for two things.

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
One is initially we're going to use it organize our thinking

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
about all the hypothesis about every part of our business.

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,000
But second is we're going to get out of the building and actually turn those hypothesis into fact as we'll

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
find out how to do later and then as we turn those hypothesis into facts,

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
we'll be updating the canvas on a regular basis and it will become a scorecard--

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
a way to keep score for our progress of how much we've learned.

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So what this means is instead of writing the operating plan and financial forecast first,

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,000
we're going to use the Business Model Canvas to actually capture all our hypothesis first.

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
For the search for the business model, we're going to start with the model first

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
and then after we find the model, we get to write it up.
