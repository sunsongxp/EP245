1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
What we now know is most startups fail from a lack of customers

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
than from a failure of product development and that's really interesting even in Silicon Valley

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
where we would probably take more technical risk

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
per square inch or square foot than anywhere else in the world.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We go out of business typically not because we didn't deliver a product.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We go out of business, because we didn't find enough customers to pay us enough money.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
That's a big idea, because if you think about it, we have all these processes

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
to manage the engineering process, why?

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Because that is the biggest risk in a large company,

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
but we had no processes to manage the customer risk.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
In fact, the best we could do, in the old days, is hire a VP of sales who told you

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
"Oh, I have a great Rolodex, great set of contacts."

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
But we really have no formal process for searching for what customers needs are,

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
and in fact, we've just come up with one and that's going to be a key part of this course.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This search for the business model.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
This search for the truth is called customer development,

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and customer development really has two pieces, the search and its execution,

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And in this class, we're going to be talking about the first two steps, customer discovery,

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
customer validation, the pivots that connect them, and then a few that are lucky.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We actually get to execute your business model in customer creation and company building.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The other piece that goes with the process in a startup

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
is now in a customer development process but in agile engineering process.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
One example is extreme programing or XP, which basically

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
is built around this idea of iteration and incremental delivery of the product.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
This is a big idea; it says instead of building every possible feature on day one,

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
we're actually going to incrementally and iteratively interact with customers,

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
test each portion of the product, and see if what we're building

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
actually has a home outside the building.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So what this really means is that for process instead of just going to execution first,

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
hiring product managers, doing waterfall development, or maybe even agile nowadays,

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
we're actually going to start with a customer development process

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
coupled with some kind of agile engineering process.

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Which one you pick? How to use XP as an example?

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But it could be whatever your favorite process is, and by the way,

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
don't only think that agile engineering and agile development is about software.

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Toyota and the Toyota production system actually have it for a hardware of decade before anybody

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
in software who ever thought about it.

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So you could be building products anything from microprocessors to medical equipment

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,000
to hardware, software, etc. using an iterative and incremental engineering process.

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And again, once you're done with that, of course, you want to manage this in a formal process,

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
but not before you do the plan.
