1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
What did we use to believe on how you physically build a startup?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
What was the process we used?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We used to build startups by managing processes.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We said, "Well hey, we understand how to build products."

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We built them exactly like we built them in large companies.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We hire product managers, and we do something called waterfall engineering,

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
which I'll explain in a second which basically are step by step by step.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
In fact, what we used to do is we used to draw this diagram on napkins.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We used to say, "Well you come up on a concept then you raise some seed funding and then you

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
go into product development, and then you have alpha test, beta test, and first customership.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
What could be wrong with that?

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
In fact for 30-40 years this was the canonical model for how to build startups

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and we'd say marketing, well, we understand.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
While engineering is developing the product, marketing is creating all the marketing

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
communications material, hiring a PR agency, and creating early buzz and then from marketing

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
the world's most fun job was have the party.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You get to create demand by having a launch event and you think about branding

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and your job really was to create end-user demand and derive it into the potential sales channel.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
For sales, what that meant is unless the VP of Sales was the founder you tended to hire them

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
around the time engineering were saying, "We're in alpha and beta test."

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
And they we're going out and starting to hire their first sale staff

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and they were looking at your 5-year revenue plan

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
and since it obviously came from a burning bush and it was the word of God

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
they were just going to execute that plan.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Why? Because it's said so and you said so and if you had investors they said so.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
There might not be any facts behind it but there it was. It was the spreadsheet.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And so they were building the sales organization so again and at first customership,

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
if marketing was going to drive demand they were jut going to have a sales curve that took off

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
because the revenue plan said so.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The next piece was the Bus Dev.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
In business development used to mean the group that put together

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
all the deals to create the whole product.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The whole product meant startups just because of their size are incapable of creating

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
all the features and services, etc., that a mainstream customer might need.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So why don't we hire business development people to do partnerships.

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So at first customership we could look like a large company for mainstream  customers.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The only fallacy in this is that you assume that your first customers are going to be in the mainstream.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It turns up for most startups your first customers are actually crazy people like you

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,000
and so therefore creating this entire cloud of deals are actually useful a year after first customership

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
but in fact just get in your way on day one.

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The other piece is engineering, and engineering--how simple could that be? It was understood.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
We did exactly what we did in the large corporations.

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You wrote a market requirements document then engineering shut their doors,

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
rolled up their sleeves, and went into waterfall engineering, which we'll describe a little later.

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You hired a QA department then at the end finally when it was all done you hired a

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
tech pubs department and all the products were ready to go in version 1.0.

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
All the features at one time at first customership.

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And this for 30 or 40 years was the way we thought about startups.

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
There can be no other way. This is how we manage the process.

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
We now know these are just simply wrong and I'll explain to you what we're going to do instead.
