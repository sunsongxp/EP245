1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let's take a look at what we used to believe and then contrast it to what we now know.
我们来看看曾经被认为是正确的理念，并对比如今我们的看法

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
One of the biggest fallacies was believing that startups
最大的错误之一，就是认为创业公司

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
are just smaller versions of a large company.
乃缩小版的大公司

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That everything you do in a large company, you'll do on day one of a startup.
即是大公司里的每项分工，从一开始就会照样复制到创业公司

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
What we now know is something very different.
我们现在的看法大不相同

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The core difference is that startups do something called search
关键的不同是，创业公司主要做探索和开发

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
while large companies spend their time, at least their core time, executing.
而大公司主要把时间花在执行上

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
One of the questions we'll answer is search for what and execute what.
问题之一是探索开发什么、执行什么，我们待会儿来谈

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And so later on in this lecture, you'll see the difference
在后面的课程，你会看到它们的区别

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and then in fact will make you a much better enterpreneur.
到时候，我们会使你成为一个更优秀的创业者
