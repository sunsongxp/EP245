00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let's take a look at what we used to believe and then contrast it to what we now know.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
One of the biggest fallacies was believing that startups

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
are just smaller versions of a large company.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That everything you do in a large company, you'll do on day one of a startup.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
What we now know is something very different.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The core difference is that startups do something called search

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
while large companies spend their time, at least their core time, executing.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
One of the questions we'll answer is search for what and execute what.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And so later on in this lecture, you'll see the difference

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
and then in fact will make you a much better enterpreneur.
