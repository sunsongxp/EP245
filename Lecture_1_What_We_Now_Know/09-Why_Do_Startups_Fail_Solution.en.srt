00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Why do startups fail? Well, the answer is really all of the above.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Co-founders do fight.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Somewhere between a quarter and third of startups

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
never even get to the beginning of the company because the founders just couldn't agree.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Two is that sometimes your vision is just too far in advance to actually be built.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The three is it's such an interesting vision or such a bad vision,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
but it can't attract sufficient capital to get started

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and it's maybe too expensive to fund on your own through your own resources.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And the one we'll be actually talking about in some detail during the series of lectures

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
is that you never actually found product market fit and there's too few people

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
who will buy or will use the product.
